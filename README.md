I. Software Needed:
* Git
* Node.Js
* Visual Studio Code


II. Steps to Run: 
* Download a copy of the latest commit
* Open Git-Bash
* Find the directory that contains the .json file
* Use npm to run the React application. 
Type + enter 'npm install' to install npm. Type 'npm start' to launch the website in your browser. Make sure only to use npm ci in the build process to retain the dependency graph, and npm install to install specific dependencies.


NOTE: If you're running the website on a Windows machine, make sure to toggle the package.json and global.scss files to the LF end-of-line sequence mode! Otherwise you will get a build error in React.js
